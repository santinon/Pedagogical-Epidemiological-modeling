This is a code-template for epidemiological modeling: SIR and SEIIRD/S (a variation of SEIRS) models. 

SIR = Susceptible - Infected - Recovered 

SEIIRD/S = Susceptible S, Exposed (or latent) -incubating and non-contagious persons- E, 
Asymptomatic infected -less contagious than symptomatic cases- Ia, Symptomatic infected Is, Recovered R and Deaths D

Open source libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib and Scipy), of the computer language Python, were used to construct the models.

Readers are invited to run them with their own parameters tuning.
